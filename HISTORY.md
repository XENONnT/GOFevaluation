v0.1.0
===================
* Multiple GOF tests (binned and unbinned) can be performed (#1, #5, #10, #12, #13)
* The p-value is calculated based on toy sampling from the reference or a permutation test (#2, #14)
* A wrapper class makes it convenient to perform multiple GOF tests in parallel (#19)
* An equiprobable binning algorithm is implemented. The binning can be applied upon initialisation of the GOF object and a few visualization tools are provided. (#25, #26)
* CI workflow implemented (#7)
